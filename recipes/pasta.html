<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    So, you're standing in the grocery store looking at an endless display of pasta noodles and you ask yourself, "How do you cook pasta?" 
    The good news is, it's not hard. In fact, it's one of the easiest bits of cooking you can do. 
    Still, there are a few simple tricks to master so your pasta turns out just right.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 Pound Uncooked Pasta</li>
    <li>A Large (6-8 quart) Pot</li>
    <li>4-6 quarts of Cold Water</li>
    <li>1-2 Tablespoons of Salt</li>
    <li>A Long-Handled Heat-Proof Spoon</li>
    <li>A Colander for Draining the Pasta</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Bring the water to a full, rolling boil.</b> Before adding the pasta, <b>add salt to the boiling water.</b> If you don't season the cooking water, the pasta may taste flat â€” no matter how salty the sauce may be. The temperature of the water will drop once you add the pasta, so make sure the water's at a full boil before adding the pasta noodles.</li>
    <li><b>Stir gently.</b> Short pasta should be stirred immediately after adding it to water, but let spaghetti and long strands soften for a minute before stirring. Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta cooks.</li>
    <li><b>Cook your pasta at a rapid boil until it's tender but slightly firm to the bite.</b> The longer you cook pasta, the mushier it gets. Don't rely on the clock to evaluate doneness; bite a piece instead. If it's done, it will be firm but tender and cooked through.</li>
    <li><b>Drain the pasta in a colander.</b>Then, return the drained pasta to the pot and cover to keep it warm, or toss it with sauce.</li>
    <li><b>Serve immediately.</b></li>
